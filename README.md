# Writing Documentation For Hack Oregon üå≤

*‚ÄúThe more open and collaborative you want development to be, the more crucial docs become.‚Äù* ‚Äì [Mark Phillips](https://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs)

Hack Oregon strives to be as transparent as possible. Not just with our data and development process, but it is in our mission to create transparency where it can be hard to find. Being transparent is only half the mission. It's great to gain access to code, data, or resources, but not so great if there's no explanation of what it is or how to use it.

At Hack Oregon we should work just as hard to create transparency as we do to create documentation, whether it's a step-by-step tutorial, overview or reference material.

**The goal of this session is to have a thoughtful conversation on Hack Oregon documentation and walk away actionable steps to implement for projects.** Though the projects will be specific to Hack Oregon, the conversation will cover topics tackled by anyone who is interested in documentation.

### This session will discuss the following:
* The importance of docs
* Different practices
* Documentation possibilities and solutions for Hack Oregon
