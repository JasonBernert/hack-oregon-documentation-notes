# It’s Time To Have The Talk: Writing Documentation

*“The more open and collaborative you want development to be, the more crucial docs become.”* – [Mark Phillips](https://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs)

Hack Oregon strives to be as transparent as possible. Not just with our data and development process, but it is in our mission to create transparency where it can be hard to find: government. Being transparent is only half the mission. It's great to gain access to code, data, or resources, but not so great if there's no explanation of what it is or how to use it.

At Hack Oregon we should work just as hard to create documentation as we do to create transparency, whether it's a step-by-step tutorial, overview or reference material.

The goal of this session is to have a thoughtful conversation on Hack Oregon documentation and walk away actionable steps to implement for projects. Though the projects will be specific to Hack Oregon, the conversation will cover topics tackled by anyone who is interested in documentation.

### This session will discuss the following:
* The importance of docs
* Different practices
* Documentation possibilities and solutions for Hack Oregon

## Discussion Outline

What can Hack Oregon give to the community? Just data? No! We can provide workflows, course outlines, tool implementations, design insights; all with good documentation.

Good docs help develop standards. What can Hack Oregon provide to future Hack Oregon teams? Imagine knowing all the successes and mistakes of past teams. We shouldn't be making the same mistake twice!

If we had better docs anyone could easily answer:
* Where are all the Hack Oregon projects?
* What were the projects?
* What problems did we tackle in those projects?
* How did we solve those problems?
* How can I piggyback off past work?
* What workflows are best for my project?
* What environment is best for my project? VirtualBox + Vagrant w/ Ubuntu OS? Python VirtualENV? Docker?
