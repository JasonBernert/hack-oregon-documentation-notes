# It‚Äôs Time To Have The Talk: Writing Documentation

*‚ÄúThe more open and collaborative you want development to be, the more crucial docs become.‚Äù* ‚Äì [Mark Phillips](https://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs)

Hack Oregon strives for transparency. Not only with our data and development process, but it‚Äôs literally our mission statement. Though it‚Äôs great to give access to code, data, and resources, it‚Äôs not so great if there‚Äôs no explanation of what it is or how to use it.

We should work just as hard to create documentation as we do to be open source, whether it‚Äôs a step-by-step tutorial, overview or reference material, because documentation is a big part of transparency.

The goal of this session is to have a thoughtful conversation on Hack Oregon documentation practices and walk away with actionable steps for projects. Though the projects will be specific to Hack Oregon, the conversation will cover topics tackled by anyone interested in documentation.

### This session will discuss the following:
* The importance of documentation
* Different practices
* Known documentation pitfalls and possible solutions

## Discussion Outline

What can Hack Oregon give to the community? Just data? No! We can provide workflows, course outlines, tool implementations, design insights; all with good documentation.

Good docs help develop standards. What can Hack Oregon provide to future Hack Oregon teams? Imagine knowing all the successes and mistakes of past teams. We shouldn‚Äôt be making the same mistake twice!

If we have great docs anyone could easily answer:
* Where are all the Hack Oregon projects?
* What were the projects?
* What problems did we tackle in those projects?
* How did we solve those problems?
* How can I piggyback off past work?
* What workflows are best for my project?
* What environment is best for my project? VirtualBox + Vagrant w/ Ubuntu OS? Python VirtualENV? Docker?
